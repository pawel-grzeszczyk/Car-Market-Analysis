# **Car Market Analysis**

Please consider that this repository is still being developed. ⚒️

## **Project overview**:

### **Main goals**:

1. Determining how and to what extent car parameters affect its value.
2. Identifying which parameters have a statistically significant impact on the price of a car.
3. Selecting the best machine learning model for car valuation.

### **Steps:**

1. **Data aquisition** ✅

   Building web scraping program and using it to gather real data.

2. **Data cleaning** ✅

   Due to the fact that the scraped data is sourced from the internet and was self-filled by website users, it will require thorough cleaning.

3. **Quantitative analysis** ✅

   Familiarizing oneself with the data and discovering its structure through data aggregation and visualization.

4. **Price analysis** ❌

   Checking the distribution of car prices and conducting a basic analysis to determine how car parameters influence its price.

5. **ML models development and evaluation** ❌

   Development, optimization, and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms for car valuation based on its parameters.

6. **Selection of the best model** ❌

   Comparison of model results and selection of the best performing model
