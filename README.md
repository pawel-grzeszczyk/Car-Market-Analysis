# **Car Market Analysis**
By Pawe≈Ç Grzeszczyk

**Project overview**:  
Project's main goal is to run complex analysis to investigate key factors influencing the car prices.

The analysis document is split into several parts that include:

- **Data aquisition** (building web scraping programme to gather real data)
- **Exploratory data analysis** (performing a basic analysis of the data as well as looking for its structure and patterns)
- **Data Cleaning** (fixing the data types and deling with missing values in order to prepare data for further analysis)
- **Market overview** (discovering the distribution of car prices and calculating the basic statistics of the data)
- **Analysis** (asking questions and providing answers based on the data)
- **Regression model** (evaluating how each feature impacts the price)

**Project files**
Main analysis is carried in juperter notebook file: `car_market_analysis.ipynb`  
The web scraper components: `links_scraper.py` and `data_scraper.py` are both included  
in the directory.
